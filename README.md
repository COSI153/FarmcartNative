## Security

Security is not the major concern of this APP, but if this APP was published, then it shall require encryption method. Bcrypt will be a simple and strong 
method to protect the information safety of the users. An effective Bcrypt shall increase the cost to decipher the code generated by incorporating a salt 
into the password. The cost will increase exponentially when the iteration count increases, thus it will prevent the decrease of decipher cost caused by 
the technology development.

```bash
password: bcrypt.hashSync(req.body.password, 8)
```

A typical bcrypt that iterated 8 times which creates 2^8 of complexity.

## Background

demand from cities and overseas makes these poor farmers unable to sale their product. Team Summer created FarmCart in order to build up connections between
farmers and buyers from all parts of the United States. With these connections, the farmers shall be able to deliver their product directly to the buyers. 
FarmCart is beneficial for protecting the farmer's living, and the country's economy.
